Trends:
1- Charter schools are top performers with regard to reading and math scores.
2- The per student budget is approximately the same for all schools.
3- Charter schools have fewer student than District schools.

School size should be looked at to determine whether that is a factor in student performance. Since overall spending per student is about the same (approximately $600) perhaps how budgets are actually used should be analyzed.
